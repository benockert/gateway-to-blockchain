const blockchainEntrepreneurshipDescription = "This credential was issued on completion of the first annual launch of the Boston Blockchain Associationâ€™s Gateway to Blockchain summer immersion program. As part of this program, participants spent 10-weeks learning about various applications of blockchain across industries. Rather than relying on a curriculum, participants learned from real entrepreneurs currently creating value with blockchain each week. Visiting entrepreneurs (speakers) spoke on their vantage point to the emerging industry, how they leveraged the technology to solve problems, and their advice for the next generation of entrepreneurs. In addition to these weekly speaker series, participants also demonstrated applied learning through a final startup competition. Participants broke into teams after week 3 of the program. Throughout the last weeks, teams developed startup concepts that either leveraged blockchain or explained the initial plan to leverage the technology and what findings drove the decision not to utilize it. Holders of this credential can be expected to have a strong foundation on blockchain use-cases and an accelerated understanding of how to apply the technology as entrepreneurs. The following is a linear schedule of speakers and topics they addressed throughout the program. "
